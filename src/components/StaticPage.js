                            Many existing platforms let users share their music such as Spotify, Instagram,
                            and SoundCloud, but there are no designated platforms that are <em>solely dedicated
                                to musicians and connecting them online</em>. MusicRoom is for musicians, specifically
                            musicians in colleges and universities nationwide. It provides a place for college
                            students to <em>share songs, form groups, and interact with other student musicians</em>.
                            We think our app should work intuitively, as we used common design conventions and
                            features that are seen in other social apps.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            MusicRoom enables users to search based on their interests. For example, a student
                            can look for a singer near their location by searching for schools local to them.
                            Users can also search based on skills and genre; we want to include musicians of
                            diverse backgrounds and experiences. We account for skill sets, genres, and school
                            attending as <em>we want musicians to highlight the key details when connecting</em>. The
                            app additionally encourages users to share their snippets online when they want to
                            share their songs and musical projects. Through a platform that lets users interact
                            with other works, it forms interactions and communities between musicians when
                            discovering new and trending music made by other students. The app supplements
                            musicians in colleges and universities to be creative and innovative by fueling
                            inspiration and discovery, <em>what will you create on MusicRoom?</em>

                        Current music-sharing social media platforms suffer from the oversaturation of
                        posts. For example, <em>20%</em> of Spotify’s catalog has no streams whatsoever
                        (Eriksson 2019). This poses the question — <em>how many songs are there that have the
                            potential to be successful but are not due to being overshadowed on the platform?</em>
                        Furthermore, current music streaming platforms focus more on broadcasting music
                        rather than driving collaboration and building a community of musicians. <em>How can
                            we provide more exposure for beginning and young artists?</em> To address both issues,
                        we thought that providing a platform for these artists who might have a
                        challenging time getting a foothold in the music industry would be helpful.

                        that is hard to use. Because of this, our focus was to create a platform that
                        young musicians would want to use, whose design was easy to use, and
                        <em>aesthetically ambiguous</em>, so as not to inadvertently prioritize a

External apps such as Spotify, Youtube, and Instagram are also linked to the app; users can go to the external apps from there because those apps are very popular and users want to share their interests with other musicians. Users will find the snippets section particularly useful; they may remove and change the snippets. They can also manage and view comments on their posts, as well as remove and edit them.
