            The app is designed to be simple and straightforward, because we think that the app should work intuitively,
            so we used some common design and features that are seen in other social apps. The app will enable users to
            search based on their interests, for example, if a UW student looks for a singer near their location, they
            can just search based on school. It totally makes sense because if they want to form a group, location
            matters sometimes. They could search based on skill and genre too; many singers have different tastes and skill. The
            app encourages users to share their snippets online because they want to share their songs and if someone likes
            their songs, they could have the opportunity to interact with other musicians; users can leave comments on each
            other. The app helps college students to be creative and innovative.

            The site will also encourage engagement with other users through interactive posts and an appealing
            interface. The app aims to be easy to navigate and personalized for ones customizable profile and experience, using
            elements and design choices based on existing social media and networking platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and
            LinkedIn. Because the app is made for musicians and publicizes music as a whole, we want users to have a sense of
            familiarity when using the platforms features such as chatting with other musicians, uploading files relating to music,
            and playing uploaded snippets of music (which is also inspired by Spotify). We will prioritize user profiles as
            the key to forming networks with other users and presenting information that helps create impressions, through
            displaying skill sets, an “About” section, and uploaded Snippets to gauge their works and skill level.
