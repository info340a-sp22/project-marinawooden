    <h1>Interaction / Solution:</h1>

    <p>
        The app is designed to be simple and straightforward, because we think that the app should work intuitively, <br>
        so we used some common design and features that are seen in other social apps. The app will enable users to <br>
        search based on their interests, for example, if a UW student looks for a singer near their location, they <br>
        can just search based on school. It totally makes sense because if they want to form a group, location matters <br>
        sometimes. They could search based on skill and genre too; many singers have different tastes and skill. The app <br>
        encourages users to share their snippets online because they want to share their songs and if someone likes their <br>
        songs, they could have the opportunity to interact with other musicians; users can leave comments on each other. <br>
        The app helps college students to be creative and innovative.

        The site will also encourage engagement with other users through interactive posts and an appealing interface. <br>
        The app aims to be easy to navigate and personalized for ones customizable profile and experience, using elements <br>
        and design choices based on existing social media and networking platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn. <br>
        Because the app is made for musicians and publicizes music as a whole, we want users to have a sense of familiarity <br>
        when using the platforms features such as chatting with other musicians, uploading files relating to music, and <br>
        playing uploaded snippets of music (which is also inspired by Spotify). We will prioritize user profiles as the key <br>
        to forming networks with other users and presenting information that helps create impressions, through displaying <br>
        skill sets, an “About” section, and uploaded Snippets to gauge their works and skill level.
