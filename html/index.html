    <p>
        The app is designed to be simple and straightforward, because we think that the app should work intuitively, <br>
        so we used some common design and features that are seen in other social apps. The app will enable users to <br>
        search based on their interests, for example, if a UW student looks for a singer near their location, they <br>
        can just search based on school. It totally makes sense because if they want to form a group, location matters <br>
        sometimes. They could search based on skill and genre too; many singers have different tastes and skill. The app <br>
        encourages users to share their snippets online because they want to share their songs and if someone likes their <br>
        songs, they could have the opportunity to interact with other musicians; users can leave comments on each other. <br>
        The app helps college students to be creative and innovative. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The site will also encourage engagement with other users through interactive posts and an appealing interface. <br>
        The app aims to be easy to navigate and personalized for ones customizable profile and experience, using elements <br>
        and design choices based on existing social media and networking platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn. <br>
        Because the app is made for musicians and publicizes music as a whole, we want users to have a sense of familiarity <br>
        when using the platforms features such as chatting with other musicians, uploading files relating to music, and <br>
        playing uploaded snippets of music (which is also inspired by Spotify). We will prioritize user profiles as the key <br>
        to forming networks with other users and presenting information that helps create impressions, through displaying <br>
        skill sets, an “About” section, and uploaded Snippets to gauge their works and skill level.

                We will cater towards college and university music creatives of all types. However also music creators and enthusiasts will be a secondary base.

                The information users will be viewing are aimed at facilitating promoting and collaboration among college and university music creatives. 
                This means users can see a musician's list of skills, the genres of songs they produce, the school they are currently attending, 
                the number of followers they have, who they are following, and links to other external apps such as YouTube, Instagram, or Spotify. 
                Furthermore, users can also see music snippets that musician uploaded on to their account page. Each snippet will show a title, an author, 
                a cover image, a description, the length of the snippet, and the number of likes and comments the snippet has. Users can also see posts made 
                by a musican, and the comments and likes on that post.
