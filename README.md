# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool. For the purpose of discovering new and upcoming artists across schools, this is the app made for connecting with music creatives, uploading files and posts of their work, and networking for collaboration.
