                    Problem Overview
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The general topic that we wanted to address was the collaboration between musicians and music creatives in making their projects. Developing informal networks between musicians enables variation and creativity in their works through meaningful relationships and collaborations (Albinsson, 2017). Because of this, we wanted to make a webpage that serves the purposes of sharing projects, promoting engaging connections, and letting users gain exposure for their work.

                <h3>
                    Technology Problem
                </h3>
                <p>
                    There are close to no designated platform that treats musicians, much less student/scholar music creatives, as its main stakeholder while allowing them to establish a creative network and promote collaboration. Quadio is an example of such a platform, but its webpage does not have an interactive preview or application of its marketed mobile app.

                <h3>
                    Similar Applications
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Established music streaming platforms such as Spotify, YouTube, and Soundcloud are oversaturated, an example being 20% of Spotify's catalog having 0 streams (Eriksson, 2019), and is hard to grant networking interactions between said music creatives. As mentioned earlier, Quadio aims for community, networking, and collaboration for college musical artists but has a very bold interface that could be touched up.

            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Users</h3>
                <p>
                    We will cater towards college and university music creatives of all types. However, other general music creators and enthusiasts will be a secondary target audience.
                </p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>Date & Information</h3>
                <p>
                    The information users will be viewing are aimed at facilitating promoting and collaboration among college and university music creatives.
                    This means users can see a musician's list of skills, the genres of songs they produce, the school they are currently attending,
                    the number of followers they have, who they are following, and links to other external apps such as YouTube, Instagram, or Spotify.
                    Furthermore, users can also see music snippets that musician uploaded on to their account page. Each snippet will show a title, an author,
                    a cover image, a description, the length of the snippet, and the number of likes and comments the snippet has. Users can also see posts made
                    by a musican, and the comments and likes on that post.

                <h3>Interaction / Solution:</h3>
                <p>
                    The app is designed to be simple and straightforward, because we think that the app should work intuitively,
                    so we used some common design and features that are seen in other social apps. The app will enable users to
                    search based on their interests. For example, if a UW student looks for a singer near their location, they
                    can search based on schools around them. This makes sense because if they want to form a group, location
                    matters for convenience. They could also search based on skill and genre too; many singers have different tastes and skill. The
                    app encourages users to share their snippets online because they want to share their songs and if someone likes
                    their songs, they could have the opportunity to interact with other musicians; users can leave comments on each
                    other. The app helps college students to be creative and innovative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The site will also encourage engagement with other users through interactive posts and an appealing
                    interface. The app aims to be easy to navigate and personalized for ones customizable profile and experience, using
                    elements and design choices based on existing social media and networking platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and
                    LinkedIn. Because the app is made for musicians and publicizes music as a whole, we want users to have a sense of
                    familiarity when using the platforms features such as chatting with other musicians, uploading files relating to music,
                    and playing uploaded snippets of music (which is also inspired by Spotify). We will prioritize user profiles as
                    the key to forming networks with other users and presenting information that helps create impressions, through
                    displaying skill sets, an “About” section, and uploaded Snippets to gauge their works and skill level.
