We aim to provide a <em>user-friendly interface </em>and platform to provoke collaboration &#8212; after all, <em>collaboration creates innovation.</em>

                        <h2>Why did we make this app?</h2>
                        <p>
                          Many existing platforms let users share their music such as Spotify, Instagram, and SoundCloud, but there are no designated platforms that are <em>solely dedicated to musicians and connecting them online</em>. MusicRoom is for musicians, specifically musicians in colleges and universities nationwide. It provides a place for college students to <em>share songs, form groups, and interact with other student musicians</em>. We think our app should work intuitively, as we used common design conventions and features that are seen in other social apps. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          MusicRoom enables users to search based on their interests. For example, a student can look for a singer near their location by searching for schools local to them. Users can also search based on skills and genre; we want to include musicians of diverse backgrounds and experiences. We account for skill sets, genres, and school attending as <em>we want musicians to highlight the key details when connecting</em>. The
                          app additionally encourages users to share their snippets online when they want to share their songs and musical projects. Through a platform that lets users interact with other works, it forms interactions and communities between musicians when
                          discovering new and trending music made by other students. The app supplements musicians in colleges and universities to be creative and innovative by fueling inspiration and discovery, <em>what will you create on MusicRoom?</em>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <img src="img/music1.svg" alt="People working together on music">
            <p>
                Current music-sharing social media platforms suffer from the oversaturation of
                posts. For example, <em>20%</em> of Spotify’s catalog has no streams whatsoever
                (Eriksson 2019). This poses the question — <em>how many songs are there that have the
                potential to be successful but are not due to being overshadowed on the platform?</em>
                Furthermore, current music streaming platforms focus more on broadcasting music
                rather than driving collaboration and building a community of musicians. <em>How can
                we provide more exposure for beginning and young artists?</em> To address both issues,
                we thought that providing a platform for these artists who might have a
                challenging time getting a foothold in the music industry would be helpful.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our idea was also motivated by our firsthand experiences. We are more than just
                students and developers — we have <em>personal hobbies</em> and one of which is
                <em>creating</em> music. However, <em>as people who are not actively pursuing a
                career in music or musical education</em>, we have <em>found it hard to create
                the same network</em> as we have in the fields that we are studying. We have
                found that currently <em>there are few social networking platforms that
                specifically cater to connecting young creatives</em>, and those that do are
                either much <em>too specialized</em> or <em>have a poor interface design</em>
                that is hard to use. Because of this, our focus was to create a platform that
                young musicians would want to use, whose design was easy to use, and
                <em>aesthetically ambiguous</em>, so as not to inadvertently prioritize a
                certain style of musician over another.
